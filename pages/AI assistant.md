- This list does not include Bard (only US-accessible) and Bing (requires MS Edge, proprietary software). We included only services that offer a free trial (but we used a paid ChatGPT subscription for access to GPT4)
  
  Products used for summarization:
- [[Kagi's universal summarizer (US)]]
- [[Elicit.org]]
-
- [Scite]
- : summary was kind of ok but lacked some nuance; output was fast.
- Scite.ai (16€/month)
- [[GPT4]]
- Products we excluded from evaluation - unclear whether they have an AI component.
